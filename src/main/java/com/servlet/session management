session management:-
http protocol and web servers are stateless that is for the web server ,every request is a new request to process 
and they can not identify wheather it is coming from same clint or new a new  clint.
some times in web application ,we need to identify the clint and process the request as pr the clint .
Examlpes:-
iN A shopping cart application like (amazon, flipcart,myntra) we should know 
who is sending the request to add an item 
In  which cart the item has to be added
who is sending place order request so that it can charge the amount to correct  line
Session is a  period of time where user sends multiple request and ricive multiple responses 
in multiple request user ay send some data that should be stored and manage  in the server
session will be stored line clint specific data.
session is conversaional state between clint and server.
within the user session , you have to do two things
1)identify the clint 
2)manage the conversaional state (clint specific data ).
to identify the clint as new or old, container usages session id 
To store clints conversational state or data, we have to use Http Session object
